## Chip ##
This module creates an array of position which is used as an iterator to move around a defined area.

The module supports few algorithms which may be used by the user to discover areas of interests:

* Typewriter (`chip.lr = True`)
    Return to beginning after reching the line (`chip.vertical = False`) or column (`chip.vertical = True`)

* Random (`chip.random = True`)
    Shuffle the coordinates

* Vertical (`chip.vertical = True`)
    Iterates vertically rather than horizontally

* Reverse (`chip.reverse = True`)
    Flip the coordinates (start from furthest)

### Example code ##
```
from glitch3d import chip

target = chip()

# origin
target.offset_x = 0.0
target.offset_y = 0.0

# chip definition
target.x_max = 250.0
target.y_max = 250.0

# steps
target.steps = 10

target.lr = False
target.random = False
target.vertical = False
target.reverse = False

#start iterator
myiter = iter(target)
for x in range(0,50):
    new_pos = next(target)

```

A jupyter notebook is available to play around and visualize the chosen algorithm movements.


## Printer ##
This module offers basic functions to drive a 3D Marlin compatible printer through USB (e.g. to perform FI attacks).

The master branch will be kept as generic as possible.

Some printers may not behave identically, therefore branches with specific settings are available for fundamental differences.

The module has been tested on the following models:
- Creality Ender3 (ender3)
- Creality 6 SE (6se)

## Example code for CR-6 SE ##
```
from glitch3d import printer

# Define Serial port settings
serial_port = "/dev/ttyUSB0" # or set to None for automatic detection
serial_port = None 
serial_baud = 115200
serial_timeout = 1

# Establish connection with the printer
p = printer(port=serial_port,baudrate=serial_baud, timeout=serial_timeout)

# Define printer bed limits (mm)
p.limits["min_x"] = 0.0
p.limits["max_x"] = 235.0
p.limits["min_y"] = 0.0
p.limits["max_y"] = 235.0
p.limits["min_z"] = 0.0
p.limits["max_z"] = 250.0
p.limits["min_s"] = 0.1
p.limits["max_s"] = 100.0

# Enter Manual mode
p.manual()

```

## Manual mode ##
In Manual mode, the following keystrokes are supported:

* `up` Move probe forward / Y + step
* `down` Move probe forward / Y - step
* `right` Move probe right / X + step
* `left` Move probe left / X - step 
* `u` Raise probe / Z + step
* `d` Lower probe / Z - step
* `+` Increase step (0.1,1,10,100)
* `-` Decrease step (100,10,1,0.1)
* `s` Manual step definition
* `h` Home on XY !!! WARNING printer dependant
* `z` Home on XYZ 

For safety reasons, a small routine was added to raise the probe of 20.0 mm before homing.
